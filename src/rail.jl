==========================================
This contains functions for getting information about WMATA's rail (Metro) stations.

Given that WMATA's API has methods for buses as well â€“ I thought it may make sense to split 
those up this way.

    from messing about in the API, there are cases where first/last train info is coming back empty and 
    resulting in an out of bounds error in Julia. I'm setting a drop condition so that if these 
    successfully run, the function will return the full dataframe. Otherwise, first/last train info 
    will be blank.
