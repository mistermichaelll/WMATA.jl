                RAIL
==========================================
This contains functions for getting information about WMATA's rail (Metro) stations.

Given that WMATA's API has methods for buses as well â€“ I thought it may make sense to split 
those up this way.

Function Name: station_list 
Description: Returns a dataframe of station location and address information based on a given LineCode. 
Arguments:
    1) LineCode - can be empty or one of the following two-letter abbreviations: 
        RD - Red
        YL - Yellow
        GR - Green
        BL - Blue
        OR - Orange
        SV - Silver

Function Name: station_timings
Description: Returns opening and scheduled first/last train times based on a given StationCode.

Note that for stations with multiple platforms (e.g.: Metro Center, L'Enfant Plaza, etc.), a distinct call is required for each StationCode to retrieve the full set of train times at such stations.

    from messing about in the API, there are cases where first/last train info is coming back empty and 
    resulting in an out of bounds error in Julia. I'm setting a drop condition (d_c) so that if these 
    successfully run, the function will return the full dataframe. Otherwise, first/last train info 
    will be blank.

#=
Function Name: rail_predictions()
Description: This function returns a dataframe with next train arrival information for one or more stations. 
Will return an empty set of results when no predictions are available. 
Use All for the StationCodes parameter to return predictions for all stations (this is default).

For terminal stations (e.g.: Greenbelt, Shady Grove, etc.), predictions may be displayed twice.

Some stations have two platforms (e.g.: Gallery Place, Fort Totten, L'Enfant Plaza, and Metro Center). To retrieve complete predictions for these stations, be sure to pass in both StationCodes.

For trains with no passengers, the DestinationName will be No Passenger.

Next train arrival information is refreshed once every 20 to 30 seconds approximately.

Function Name: path_between()

Returns a set of ordered stations and distances between two stations on the same line.

Note that this method is not suitable on its own as a pathfinding solution between stations.

    end

Function Name: station_to_station()

Returns a distance, fare information, and estimated travel time between any two stations, including those on different lines. 
Omit both parameters to retrieve data for all stations.
